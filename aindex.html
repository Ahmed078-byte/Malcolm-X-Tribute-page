            <h3 class="header">Here a time of Malcolm X life</h3>
            <div class="container">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1925</strong> - Born in Omaha, Nabraska</li>
                    <li><strong>1931</strong> - Malcolm’s father was murdered by the white supremacist Black Legion, and
                        Michigan authorities refused to prosecute those responsible.</li>
                    <li><strong>1937</strong> - Malcolm was taken from his family by welfare caseworkers. By the time he
                        reached high school age, he had dropped out of school and moved to Boston, where he became
                        increasingly involved in criminal activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>1946</strong> - Malcolm was sent to prison on a burglary conviction. It was there he
                        encountered the teachings of <b>Elijah Muhammad</b>, the leader of the Nation of Islam, whose
                        members are popularly known as <b>Black Muslims</b>. The Nation of Islam advocated Black
                        nationalism and racial separatism. Muhammad’s teachings had a strong effect on Malcolm, who
                        entered into an intense program of self-education and took the last name “X” to symbolize his
                        stolen African identity.</li>
                    <li><strong>1952</strong> - Malcolm was released from prison and became a loyal and effective
                        minister of the Nation of Islam in Harlem, New York.</li>
                    <li><strong>1960s</strong> - He began to develop a more outspoken philosophy than that of Elijah
                        Muhammad, whom he felt did not sufficiently support the civil rights movement.</li>
                    <li><strong>1963</strong> - Malcolm’s suggestion that President John F. Kennedy’s assassination was
                        a matter of the “chickens coming home to roost” provided Elijah Muhammad, who believed that
                        Malcolm had become too powerful, with a convenient opportunity to suspend him from the Nation of
                        Islam.<br></br>A few months later, Malcolm formally left the organization and made a Muslim
                        pilgrimage to Mecca, where he was profoundly affected by the lack of racial discord among
                        orthodox Muslims.</li>
                    <li><strong>1964 </strong> - He returned to America as El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz and founded the
                        Organization of Afro-American Unity, which advocated Black identity and held that racism, not
                        the white race, was the greatest foe of the African American. Malcolm’s new movement steadily
                        gained followers, and his more moderate philosophy became increasingly influential in the civil
                        rights movement, especially among the leaders of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1965</strong> - On stage at the Audubon Ballroom, Malcolm X was gunned down as his
                        pregnant wife and four daughters took cover in the front row. Three members of the Nation of
                        Islam—Mujahid Abdul Halim, Muhammad A. Aziz and Khalil Islam—were soon after charged with
                        first-degree murder. Islam and Aziz maintained their innocence.</li>
                    <li><strong>1966 </strong> - Halim confessed to the crime and testified that Islam and Aziz were
                        innocent. All three men were found guilty, however, and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2021</strong> - Aziz and Islam were exonerated after an investigation that included the
                        discovery of key FBI documents withheld from the defense and prosecution during the trial. Aziz
                        was 83 at the time of the exoneration; Islam had died in 2009. </li>
